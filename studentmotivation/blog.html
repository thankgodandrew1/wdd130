                    <p> "Education is a vital key to success but life itself holds things that could bring hindrances to many things we do, Educational success is not left 
                        out in the genre of things that could succumb to these hindrances of life, while we cannot change some of these
                        hindrances we can live to learn how to succeed in the midst of these challenges." --Our Future

                    <h1>Teamwork</h1>
                    <p>Have you ever heard about teamwork before? i guess you have. Today we will talk about it and how that would help you succeed despite hindrances.
                       I have here a definition of teamwork from the english dictionary, it is "The cooperative effort of a team or group of people to achieve a common goal." Take a moment, think about that.</p>
                    <p>Have you worked in a team before? If you have i believe you remember the less time it took your group to achieve your goal. You may be wondering how this would make you succeed during educational hindrances like your full-time work, family problems,stress, health and so on! It's good you are wondering right now because it does help you succeed. 
                    <p> Time is a major challenge in education but when we get ourselves into a team we then spend less time on projects, if there is any challenge we can have enough time to deal with that. Now tell me are you motivated towards joining a team now? In the faculty of teamwork you spend less time on assignments and projects!! Join One.</p> 
                    <p>Now let's read from Tammy keys and learn from her story.</p>

                    <h1>Story From Tammy Keys (age: 8)</h1>
                    <p>Hi everyone i'm Tammy, i would love to join others to contribute on the student motivation platform (Our Future). Usually i do have a challenge on completing my assignments on time after school, because of that i rarely spend time with my friends after school. I read one time from your site that "it's ok to ask for help when you are having a challenge on an assignment or understanding a concept so that you can spend time on some other thing"</p>
                    <p>I took the advice, i decided to always ask for help from my mom once i'm back from school. Now i don't have to spend so much time on assignments because of moms help. i also have enough time to play with my friends! -Tammy</p>
